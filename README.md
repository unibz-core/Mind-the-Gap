 * **kb** folder contains the populated models to be used as inputs of the ILP task
 * **.als** file contains the car model encoded into Alloy specifications (as output of the OntoUML converter)
 * **.thm** file can be used in Alloy to visualize the simulations as from the paper figures
 * **.conf** file is the file to be used with the DL-learner algorithm to learn the constraints
